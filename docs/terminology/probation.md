# Probation

In order to remain eligible for OSAP funding, you must successfully complete a 60% course load in each year that you receive OSAP funding. If you fail to meet this requirement, you will be placed on OSAP probation for one academic year. If you fail to successfully complete a 60% course load during the probation period then you will be placed on OSAP restriction for a minimum of one year. You will not be eligible for OSAP funding during the restriction period. In order to be reconsidered for OSAP funding, you must submit a letter which includes the reason(s) for your failure to meet academic progress requirements and a clear commitment to maintain satisfactory academic progress moving forward.

To determine the exact number of course credits that a 60% course load entails, contact an academic advisor at your post secondary institute.

::: warning
Grants are usually free money â€” but under certain circumstances, OSAP may turn your grant into a loan. This can happen if you withdraw from school, or if you drop too many courses and a reassessment shows you were not eligible for the amount you received. It can also happen if OSAP cannot verify the income reported on your application. In such cases, part or all of the grant is converted into a loan and must be repaid. See the OSAP [policy](https://osap.gov.on.ca/dc/PRDR016869)

::: warning
OSAP probation differs from post secondary academic probation. Ensure that you are familiar with both.

::: info Note
You may seek pardon from OSAP restriction during the restriction period by submitting a letter of request.
