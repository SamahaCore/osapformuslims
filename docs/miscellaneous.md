### OSAP Lifetime Limit

There is a lifetime limit of 340 weeks for student loan funding. This converts to about 19 terms which OSAP will fund.

Note: For students in doctoral programs the limit is 400 weeks and students with disabilities are granted 520 weeks.

### OSAP Grant to Loan Conversion

OSAP grants may be converted into repayable loans if recipients withdraw from studies early, reduce their course load under the minimum threshold, or provide unverifiable income information. See the full policy [here](https://osap.gov.on.ca/dc/PRDR016869).
