# Introduction

This website provides Muslim students, who are receiving financial assistance from the Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP), an easy-to-use guide on how to avoid interest. This guide will simplify for students what exactly is an OSAP loan, important OSAP policies, and the details of an OSAP loan agreement. The goal is to equip Muslim students with useful information that that will assist them in creating a personalized interest-avoidance plan. While we have provided a sidebar with shortcuts for easy access to specific sections, we strongly recommend reading the whole guide from the beginning to gain a good understanding of how OSAP works.
