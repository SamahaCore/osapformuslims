# Achieving a "True" Grace Period

In order to achieve a “true” grace period of 6 months (without any interest accruing on your outstanding loan), you must pay off the entire provincial portion of your loan prior to the start of your grace period. The provincial portion of the loan is usually significantly less than the federal portion so, for some, it may be doable.

To check the amount of your provincial loan, log into your NSLSC account. Once you’re on your dashboard, under “Funding Summary”, click the link to your loan. You should see a breakdown of your loan with the interest rates.

How to pay off provincial portion in lump sum:

1. Obtain a bank draft or normal bank cheque totalling the full provincial loan amount and make it out to the National Student Loans Service Centre (NSLSC). In the “RE” line put your student loan number. (can be found in the same “Funding Summary” page)

2. Write a letter in the format below and mail it to NSLSC’s office in Mississauga. Their address can be found on the “Contact Us” section of their website.

**Letter Format**

_NSLSC full address_
